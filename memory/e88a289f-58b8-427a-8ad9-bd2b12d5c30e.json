The clinician may consider ordering diagnostic tests such as a throat swab, blood work, or imaging studies to rule out other conditions.\n\nPlease note that Remdesivir is an antiviral medication used for COVID-19 treatment, but its use should be guided by a healthcare professional based on the patient's specific clinical scenario and risk factors.",
