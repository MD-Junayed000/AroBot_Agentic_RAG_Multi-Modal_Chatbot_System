This may include:\n\n* Fluid management: Encourage adequate hydration through oral or intravenous fluids.\n* Pain management: Recommend over-the-counter pain relievers such as Napa (paracetamol) or Aspirin (if not contraindicated).\n* Rest: Advise the patient to rest and avoid strenuous activities.\n\nHowever, I would like to note that without a confirmed diagnosis, it's essential to monitor the patient closely for signs of worsening condition. If symptoms worsen or new symptoms develop, refer immediately to a higher level of care.\n\nPlease consult with a clinician for personalized advice, as the specific treatment plan may vary depending on the underlying condition and individual patient needs.",
