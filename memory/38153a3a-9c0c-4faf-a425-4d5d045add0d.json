These are generally consistent across countries but should be verified for regional specificity when necessary.\n\nFor accurate and safe information tailored to Bangladesh's context or any other region-specific details, please consult local clinical guidelines, pharmacopeias, or speak directly with healthcare professionals in the area of interest.",
