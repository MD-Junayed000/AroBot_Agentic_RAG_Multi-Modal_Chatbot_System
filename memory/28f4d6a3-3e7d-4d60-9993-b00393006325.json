It's available in various strengths, including 500 mg tablets.\n\nIf you're looking for information on Napa as a brand name or specific product, I couldn't find any relevant information within the provided context. However, if you have more context or clarify what you mean by \"Napa,\" I'd be happy to try and assist further.\n\nPlease note that without additional context, it's difficult to provide a comprehensive answer. If you're considering using Naproxen Sodium or have questions about its use, I recommend consulting with a healthcare professional for personalized advice.",
